Weather can be a fairly dry topic so who better to spruce weather up than Yoda himself? The Force can be powerful so weather doesn't stand a chance when Yoda is making predictions.</p><p>Sit back, relax, enjoy the tunes and some memorable words of wisom from the guru himself, Yoda:</p><p>“Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is.”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“Always pass on what you have learned.”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“[Luke:] I can’t believe it. [Yoda:] That is why you fail.”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“If you end your training now — if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did — you will become an agent of evil.”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“PATIENCE YOU MUST HAVE my young padawan”</p><p>-Yoda</p><p>“Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away… to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.”</p><p>-Yoda</p></div></div><div><img id="drunk-yoda" src="images/yoda-dancing.gif" alt="drunk yoda image"></div><audio autoplay><source src="assets/yoda.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
